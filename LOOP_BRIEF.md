# Unattended autoloop brief: ptcg-abc (Pokemon TCG AI Battle Challenge)

You are working UNATTENDED in the ptcg-abc repo, invoked once per iteration by a shell driver.
Do ONE increment, then STOP. Full autonomy authorized.

SOURCE OF TRUTH: docs/plans/2026-07-02-combined-learned-eval-plan-v2.md
Read it fully before doing anything.

## RESUME STATE (2026-07-02, plan v2 just adopted, read this first)
The loop already shipped U1, U2, U3, U4 and is running U5's A/B, but all on GAUNTLET-ONLY data, before the
ladder-replay units existed. The ladder-replay units U3a and U3b are NEW in v2 and are NOT yet done. Do them
NEXT (U3a downloader, then U3b converter), do not skip them because U4/U5 already have commits. Then redo
U4's ladder-merge comparison (train gauntlet-only vs gauntlet+ladder, keep the merged model only if its AUC
on gauntlet-only test data is at least the gauntlet-only model's, document in analysis/ladder_data_ab.md),
then re-run the U5 A/B with the retained model, then U6, U7, the Phase A gate, then Phase B (U8-U12).

## Project
- Repo: C:\Users\danom\ptcg-abc   Branch: feat/phase2-learned-eval (Phase A); feat/phase3-followon (Phase B). Never touch main.
- Venv python: .venv/Scripts/python.exe   Tests: python -m pytest tests -q
- Gauntlet: python tools/gauntlet.py <agent> <opponents...> -n <N>   Build: python tools/build_submission.py
- Kaggle: .venv/Scripts/kaggle.exe ; token at ~/.kaggle/access_token (never in code or logs)

## SETUP (guard once at the start of a run)
1. Ensure on branch feat/phase2-learned-eval (Phase A) or feat/phase3-followon (Phase B); create off HEAD if missing.
2. Confirm data/training/ and data/replays/ are gitignored (data/ is already ignored, which covers both).

## EACH ITERATION (one increment, then stop)
1. git log --oneline to find the last completed unit. v2 order: U1, U2, U3, U3a, U3b, U4, U5, U6, U7, then the
   Phase A gate check, then U8-U12 on feat/phase3-followon. Honor the RESUME STATE above (U3a is next).
2. Implement the NEXT undone unit exactly as the plan specifies. Mirror existing patterns in src/, agents/, search/, tools/.
3. Write or update that unit's tests. Run python -m pytest tests -q. Must pass before committing.
4. Review your own diff; apply only safe, verified fixes.
5. Commit ONLY that unit's files (never git add -A) with the exact commit message from the plan.
6. Append to autoloop_status.md: unit advanced, test result, gate pass/fail, whether you submitted, what is next.
7. TEACH AS YOU GO: in the same autoloop_status.md entry, add 3-5 plain-language sentences explaining what
   this unit taught (e.g. what AUC means, what the gate result implies) for a coding novice. No jargon
   without a one-line definition.
8. STOP. Do not start the next unit.

## PHASE GATE
Before starting U8, confirm Phase A's definition of done is met: U1-U7 committed, U5's A/B recorded with the
learned eval at least matching the hand-tuned eval (win or documented tie), submission verified offline-clean,
writeup drafted. If not met, do not start Phase B; keep working Phase A. If U5 clearly loses, stop and revisit
the feature set before Phase B.

## SUBMISSION (protect the scarce resource)
- At most ONE Kaggle submission per iteration, only if the new agent MEASURABLY beats the current best,
  respecting the 5/day quota. Board-check FIRST: .venv/Scripts/kaggle.exe competitions submissions -c
  pokemon-tcg-ai-battle. Never resubmit a build already on the ladder. Keep the ledger in autoloop_status.md.
- search/eval.py and the Phase B search upgrades feed agent_search, which is NOT the shipped ladder agent
  (agent_heuristic ships; search has been ladder-negative, 514.7 vs 569.6). So these units improve the OFFLINE
  search and the Strategy writeup (70% of the Strategy score); they only reach the ladder once a search-revival
  makes agent_search the shipped agent. Treat the gauntlet/offline A/B as the deliverable; do NOT spend a
  scarce ladder slot on a search-side build while agent_heuristic is the king.

## HARD RULES (never break)
- No em dashes anywhere in code, comments, docs, or commit messages.
- Submitted agent runs fully offline. No sklearn/lightgbm/numpy/network at match time. Models ship as JSON plus
  a pure-Python scorer next to main.py. Training deps (scikit-learn) are dev-only, never in the submission bundle.
- Never commit data/ or engine binaries. Never commit or redistribute ladder replay JSON. data/training/ and
  data/replays/ are gitignored.
- The grader loads main.py via exec() with NO __file__ (guard every repo-relative path with
  if "__file__" in globals()); the entrypoint must be the LAST callable defined; the agent must never raise;
  the native engine is a process-global singleton (sequential matches). tests/test_grader_submission.py gates
  every build.
- Respect every GATE in the plan. A failed gate means document it and move on, not force the change in.
- Any LLM API keys come from environment variables only. Never hardcode a key.

## Stop condition for THIS run
After one coherent increment (a committed unit, or a clearly bounded chunk of one), STOP and end your turn.
